This library provides `path!`, a macro to join path components using `/`.

```toml
[dependencies]
path_macro = "1.0"
```

<br>

## Details

Python's [`pathlib.Path`] provides an egonomic API for composing paths out
of path components by overloading the division operator:

```sh
$ python3
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> p = Path('a')
>>> q = p / 'b' / 'c'
>>> q
PosixPath('a/b/c')
```

The `path!` macro provides a similar API for Rust paths without having
to overload [`Path`] or [`PathBuf`].

```rust
use std::path::Path;

use path_macro::path;

fn main() {
    let p = path!(Path::new("a") / "x" / "y" / "z");

    #[cfg(unix)]
    assert_eq!(p, Path::new("a/x/y/z"));

    #[cfg(windows)]
    assert_eq!(p, Path::new("a\\x\\y\\z"));
}
```

## Prior Art

In [rust-lang/rust#62989], the idea of implementing [`Div`] for [`Path`] and
[`PathBuf`] was sidestepped by pointing out that the `path!` macro existed
in [dtolnay/trybuild:src/path.rs]. In [dtolnay/trybuild#46], the library
author expressed a lack of interest in pulling out the macro into a
standalone crate and encouraged others to do it. This crate is that.
